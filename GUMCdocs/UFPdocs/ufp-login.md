Note that local access is not fully supported at this time. If the protect web portal is down or if CEC internet is down, you can log in to the local web page by visiting [this link](https://10.0.0.4:7443) and signing in with your Ubiquiti or local account. For now you will have to choose to continue past browser warning about a self signed SSL certificate; this will be fixed in the future. Local livestreaming of the camera with VLC will continue to work if internet is down. The system stores all recordings locally; internet is not required for NVR to function.
