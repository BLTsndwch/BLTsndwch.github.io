<p>Above wave plot my by bi-weekly top 5 listened to artists was generated by <a href="http://c26k.com/lastfmextrastats/">Last.fm Extra Stats</a> and is being served to you in a bandwidth friendly zoomable way by <a href="https://github.com/openseadragon/openseadragon">OpenSeadragon</a>.</p>
<p><b>Caveat: a large percentage of my listening is not captured by this data.</b> The nulls are gaps in the data collection, not periods of no listening. (I certainly could not last that long without music.) My homebrew plot script will be finished soon(TM) and should(TM) both fill in the gaps and make the periods with data more comprehensive.</p>
